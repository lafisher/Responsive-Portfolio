       <p>Hi! I'm Leigh, a yoga teacher, writer, interdisciplinary theatre artist, and burgeoning web developer from Austin, TX. Working in the theater world for nearly 30 years (I started VERY young, stop trying to do the math) has given me a keen eye for design, and the ability to make somthing really cool with virtually no time and even less money.</p>

	     <p>I also quite likes punching things, and am working towards my orange belt in Krav Maga.</p>

	     <p>I started using my writing and design skills to create Wellsitesâ„¢ (health and wellness focused websites) in WordPress. When I learned that a writer and designer who can also code is called a Unicorn I immediately knew that was what I wanted to be when I grew up. And here we are.</p>
